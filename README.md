Dotfiles
========

## System

These dotfiles are used to configure my arch linux setup. They are normally stored under ~/dotfiles/ and then symlinked via the linker script provided in the bin folder. There is also a script which is used to update the stored dotfiles.

## To Do 
- Write bin/dotlinker.py
-- Parses bin/filelist and links the existing dotfiles to its destination.
- Write bin/dotupdater.py
-- Checks if the dotfiles are up to date and updates them if necessary.
- Add missing files
