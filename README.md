Dotfiles
========

## System

These dotfiles are used to configure my arch linux setup. They are normally stored under ~/dotfiles/ and then symlinked via the linker script provided in the bin folder. There is also a script which is used to update the stored dotfiles.

## To Do 
- Write bin/linker.sh
- Write bin/update_dotfiles.sh
- Add missing files
